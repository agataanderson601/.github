## 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning

I’m always expanding my skill set! Currently, I’m diving deeper into:

- **Rust** for system-level programming
- **GraphQL** for efficient API design
- **Machine Learning** with TensorFlow and PyTorch

## 💡 My Approach to Development

I believe in writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. I’m a strong advocate for test-driven development (TDD) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices. Collaboration and communication are key to my workflow, and I enjoy working in agile environments where feedback and iteration are encouraged.
